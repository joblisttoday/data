description: Airbyte is the open-source standard for EL(T). We enable data teams
  to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses,
  lakes, and other destinations. We believe only an open-source approach can
  solve the problem of data integration, as it enables us to cover the long tail
  of integrations while enabling teams to adapt pre-built connectors to their
  needs.
