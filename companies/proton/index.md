description: Proton was founded in 2014 by a group of scientists who met at the
  European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Our first product, Proton
  Mail, is now the world’s largest encrypted email service. Subsequent Proton
  products, such as Proton VPN, Proton Calendar, and Proton Drive, give our
  users full control over how and with whom their data is shared.
