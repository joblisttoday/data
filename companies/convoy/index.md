description: Convoy is transforming the $800 billion trucking industry, where
  even 10 years ago, most truck drivers did not have smartphones and paper
  driver logs were common. In 2015, Convoy launched the digital freight movement
  with an open and fully connected marketplace for brands and manufacturers to
  work directly with freight carriers who move truckload shipments throughout
  the country. This ‘Digital Freight Network’ is powered by machine learning and
  automation, and supported by a broad, ever-growing set of features that
  benefit both sides of the marketplace.
