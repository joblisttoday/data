  Aledade is a new company with an old-fashioned goal: putting doctors back in
  control of health care. Aledade partners with independent, primary care
  physicians to provide everything the doctors need to create and run an
  Accountable Care Organization (ACO) – from business and practice
  transformation services to upfront capital and a cutting-edge technology
  platform. Our customized solutions – and our continuous, on-the-ground support
  of our physician partners – will help doctors in all types of communities
  across America preserve their autonomy, deliver better care to their patients,
  reduce overall costs, and keep independent physician practices flourishing.
