description: Apollo Agriculture is the commercial farming platform for
  small-scale farmers that helps farmers maximize their profits. Apollo uses
  agronomic machine learning, remote sensing, and mobile phones to deliver
  financing, high-quality farm products, and optimized advice that can more than
  double farm profitability, starting in Kenya. Our team brings together
  technology and operations experience from The Climate Corporation (acquired
  for USD ~$1 Billion), McKinsey, Acre, Google, and One Acre Fund. We value
  evangelical pursuit of mission with a pragmatic approach, humility in the face
  of challenge, active discussion of disagreements, and considerate listening.
