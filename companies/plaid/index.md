  We believe that the way people interact with their finances will drastically
  improve in the next few years. We’re dedicated to empowering this
  transformation by building the tools and experiences that thousands of
  developers use to create their own products. Plaid powers the tools millions
  of people rely on to live a healthier financial life. We work with thousands
  of companies like Venmo, SoFi, several of the Fortune 500, and many of the
  largest banks to make it easy for people to connect their financial accounts
  to the apps and services they want to use. Plaid’s network covers 12,000
  financial institutions across the US, Canada, UK and Europe. Founded in 2013,
  the company is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in New York, Salt
  Lake City, Washington D.C., London and Amsterdam. #LI-Remote
