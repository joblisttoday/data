description: "Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that’s working to
  build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. Large, general
  systems of today can have significant benefits, but can also be unpredictable,
  unreliable, and opaque: our goal is to make progress on these issues. For now,
  we’re primarily focused on research towards these goals; down the road, we
  foresee many opportunities for our work to create value commercially and for
  public benefit."
