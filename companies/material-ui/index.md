description: MUI started with Material UI, the most successful React
  implementation of Google's Material Design. We have gained a large following,
  thanks to our focus on Material Design fidelity, our obsession with details,
  on offering a large number of components, our community engagement, and by
  carefully improving the DX. Today, countless teams and organizations rely on
  our open-source libraries to build their design system.
