  Worldcoin is an iris biometric cryptocurrency project developed by San
  Francisco and Berlin-based Tools for Humanity. Founded in 2019 by OpenAI chief
  executive Sam Altman, Max Novendstern, and Alex Blania, it is backed by VC
  Andreessen Horowitz.


  Worldcoin is an open-source protocol, supported by a global community of developers, individuals, economists and technologists committed to expanding participation in, and access to, the global economy. Its community is united around core beliefs in the inherent worth and equality of every individual, the right to personal privacy, and open and public collaboration. These beliefs are reflected in what the community is building: a public utility to connect everyone to the global economy.
