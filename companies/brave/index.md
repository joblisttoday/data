description: Brave is on a mission to protect the human right to privacy online.
  We’ve built a free web browser that blocks creepy ads and trackers by default,
  a private search engine with a truly independent index, a browser-native
  crypto wallet, and a private ad network (opt-in!) that directly rewards you
  for your attention. And we’re just getting started. Already 50 million people
  have switched to Brave for a faster, more private web. Millions more switch
  every month.
