description: Founded in 2019, Hopin brings brands and communities together
  around highly interactive and engaging experiences. We believe that people
  should have access to the conversations, moments and ideas they care most
  about, no matter where they are.  Through our highly scalable platform,
  participants are able to learn, engage, and connect from anywhere in the
  world. Hopin started as a virtual events solution but we have since
  meaningfully expanded our offering from virtual events to hybrid and in-person
  events, as well as video and workplace collaboration products.
