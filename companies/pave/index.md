  At Pave, we believe the world of compensation is broken, and we’re going to
  fix it. Today, teams cobble together hundreds of messy spreadsheets and
  outdated surveys to determine how to compensate their employees. At best,
  they’re leveraging stale data from an industry that is quickly evolving past
  it. Add COVID, a new remote and distributed workforce, and you have an even
  blurrier picture of what “market compensation” is, how it’s evolving, and how
  to communicate it to employees.


  That’s where we come in. Pave allows companies to benchmark compensation to leaders in their industry, analyze internal compensation data and make the right adjustments, then visually communicate compensation to their employees.  We’re building the world’s largest real-time compensation data platform on the path to help employers and employees navigate the murky world of compensation with clarity, equity, and accessibility.
