  Tether Token: The most liquid, stable and trusted stablecoin.


  Launched in 2014 by a group of Bitcoin enthusiasts and early adopters, Tether.to is a blockchain-enabled platform designed to facilitate the use of fiat currencies digitally.


  Tether created the first ‘stablecoin,’ the Tether token (USD₮), which is now one of the most traded tokens in terms of volume and has unparalleled liquidity in the cryptocurrency space. The technology and growth of Tether tokens have, in turn, launched an entirely new industry which central banks and governments are now developing.
