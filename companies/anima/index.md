description: Anima’s goal is to create a continuous design-to-code process. As
  designers and developers ourselves, we understand that by streamlining the
  handoff process, teams will deliver and innovate 10x faster. The effort behind
  this powerhouse is huge, and the result is advanced prototyping features and
  the ability to translate designs into HTML, React, and Vue code, all from
  Figma, Adobe XD & Sketch.
