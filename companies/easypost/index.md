description: Founded in 2012, EasyPost is a YC unicorn whose mission is to make
  shipping simple for businesses, from garage startups to the Fortune 500.
  Shipping, now more than ever, is the backbone of the global economy, but
  integrating the technology-enabled operations of a modern business with the
  low-tech and complex shipping industry has always been a challenge. EasyPost
  solves this problem with the first developer-friendly REST API for shipping,
  and we continue to push boundaries and discover new ways to simplify shipping
  for all.
