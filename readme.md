## How to use netlify-cms & github authentication

Netlify CMS (content management system) is the most straight forward
way to contribute to this project, and anyone is allowed to
contribute.

   to the `In Review` section.
1. administrators & contributors will discuss and review your changes
   (visible as Pull Requests on
   [github@joblisttoday/companies/pulls](https://github.com/joblisttoday/companies/pulls))
1. your pull request is then merged (or closed), and your github account notified
1. changes will be visible live on the `profiles.joblist.today` site
   (can take 1/2 hour; see gitlab-ci:sync and build)

> Netlify-CMS (in *open-authoring* mode) will handle the work to add a
> contribution to this project; to create/edit the data models, each
> companies, so you everyone can safely submit changes.

## Notes on **job board providers**

Job list today systems are able to automatically display and index
jobs from a variety of job board providers.

Test and learn more about which providers are currently available,
check [providers.joblist.today](https://providers.joblist.today)

> it is possible to use the providers as javascript web-components (to
> embed them in any website), and also in node through their simplified
> API to the job board providers (see the job list workers code).

> only providers that do not require authentication are currently
> supported; [checkout known issues (or create
> one)](https://gitlab.com/joblist/job-board-providers/-/issues)


## Project's folder structure

The folders of this project/repository are as follow:

- In `./companies`, all companies that might be hirring
- In `./tags`, all tags used to describe companies (and cities), for which we have information; can be used for featured tags etc.
- In`./cities`, all cities/region that we want to feature, because a certain number of companies are hirring there

## Deployment

Look in the `./gitlab-ci.yml` file (the github project made for
contributions, synchronises to gitlab, which runs the CI pipelines).

> The project is automatically synchronised to
> https://gitlab.com/joblist/data, which runs the `gitlab-ci.yml`
> CI/CD pipelines.

> This repository on
> Github is only used because netlify-cms open-authoring mode requires
> a repository hosted on Github ( netlifcy-cms github backend, >
> editorial-workflow mode & graphql-api activated).

## Development

There are no specific development steps. If you use the data from this
repo, remember the keys of the data might evolve, so pin your project
to a commit of this repository (and upgrade safely).

> This folder aims to be data only, with all data represented as files
> inside folders.

The data files currently have the `.md` extension as their content is
[markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and the data is
stored in the `frontmatter` part of the file (the part always at the
top of the file, between the two `---`).
